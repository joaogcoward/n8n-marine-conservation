# üåä‚ö° n8n Problem-Solving for Marine Conservation

This is a open source project where I design and share automation workflows with [n8n](https://n8n.io) to support marine research, biology, and conservation problematics. My main objective is to help researchers, NGOs, and citizen scientists protect our oceans. Since I come from the caribbean coast of Costa Rica, I have always felt a deep connection with the ocean. 

## üìå How it works

- Workflows are documented in my Notion portfolio: [n8n Problem-Solving for Marine Conservation](https://pointed-humor-a2b.notion.site/n8n-Problem-Solving-for-Marine-Conservation-256dbac1bda680e58482dda66725f87a).
- All workflows are open-source and free for NGOs, scientists, and citizen projects.
