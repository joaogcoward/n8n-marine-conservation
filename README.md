30-day challenge building n8n workflows for marine and biology causes.

# 🌊⚡ n8n Problem-Solving for Marine Conservation

This is a **30-day challenge** where I design and share automation workflows with [n8n](https://n8n.io) to support marine research, biology, and conservation problematics.

## 📌 How it works
- Each day I publish a new workflow.
- Workflows are documented in my Notion portfolio: [n8n Problem-Solving for Marine Conservation] (https://pointed-humor-a2b.notion.site/n8n-Problem-Solving-for-Marine-Conservation-256dbac1bda680e58482dda66725f87a).
- All workflows are open-source and free for NGOs, scientists, and citizen projects.
